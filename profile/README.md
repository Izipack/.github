- ## Architecture overview
There are currently two environments active, acc and prod. The azure resources mentioned belowed are all named to their environment like `-acc or -prod`.

### API
There is the shipping-api which is responsible for accepting new creation of shipments, webhook updates from smartroute

### Polling Best Estimated Delivery Time
This is done by an azure function called func-shipment-processor. This calls all the scheduled orders from the active depots to check their ETA.

To configure the active depots there is an configuration setting called SmartRoute:ActiveDepots which is a comma separated string.
